# Wadi Qusaybah Project

The **Wadi Qusaybah Project** is an archaeological research initiative focused on survey, excavation, and computational modelling of Early Holocene landscapes in Jordan.

This GitHub organization is the public hub for Wadi Quṣaybah research data and resources. Its role is deliberately narrow: to provide stable, citable access to the datasets used in project publications, while keeping analytical tooling in a separate, general-purpose methods organization: [SurveyPlanningAllocCostingAndEval](https://github.com/SurveyPlanningAllocCostingAndEval).

## Data Repositories

### [wadi_qusaybah_data](https://github.com/WadiQusaybahProject/wadi_qusaybah_data)

This repository contains publicly available survey datasets, site records, and related materials associated with project publications.

---

## Related Methodological Tools

Analytical frameworks used in project publications are maintained separately within the SurveyPlanningAllocCostingAndEval organization:

- **[optimal_allocation](https://github.com/SurveyPlanningAllocCostingAndEval/optimal_allocation)** – Bayesian allocation framework for iterative survey planning  
- **[sweep_width](https://github.com/SurveyPlanningAllocCostingAndEval/sweep_width)** – Sweep width calibration module  

These tools are generalizable and are not limited to Wadi Qusaybah applications.

## Scope

This organization functions as the authoritative public archive for Wadi Qusaybah research data.
